# node-js-assignments

This is a collection of projects that we're made during the full stack javascript developer course at the New York Code & Design Academy. 

These (smaller) projects are more focussed on the back-end were I used node.js

Note that these projects are not ment to be fully featured applications, but more to understand the code behind the functionality. 

The more interesting and bigger projects were:
  1. The blog application
  2. The user information application
  3. The bulletin board application
