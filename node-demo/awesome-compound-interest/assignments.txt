# Super mini ukulele
- Modify the compound interest app to mave the logic in a node module.
Hints: module.exports

# Super regular ukulele
- Have a customers.json with an array of customer objects, then output all customer pension results to the terminal
Hints: [{},{},{}], for loop

# SUPER MEGA UKULELE
- Make a 'customers' folder with 10 customer json files (e.g. mentor.json, paul.json etc). Make your app read all files in this directory and write the results of the pension calculations to a 'customerprojections.json' file as an array of result objects.
Hinst: read folder, parse files, loop file and call calculations, save result variable to json file.

# KING BOB
- Make a generator that populates a process.argv[2] number of customer json files with random but reasonable data (meaning it could be real people you know, no trillionaires). Then use your super mega ukulele app to calculate their hypothetical pensions.

# Style bonus
- use arrow functions ()=>{}
- use not a single var statement
- elegantly store data in objects
- have as little code as possible in the main app.js
